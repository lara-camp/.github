## 🚀Lara.camp Myanmar
Lara.camp is an online Laravel conference in Myanmar.

## 🏠Take-Home Project 2023
We would like to take our understanding of Laravel to the next level by applying what was covered at Lara.camp 2023. The conference topics provide an opportunity for both beginners with basic Laravel knowledge and more advanced developers to participate. Projects must utilize at least one technology discussed at Lara.camp 2023, such as building an e-commerce site using Inertia.

You are free to choose the overall project concept. However, submissions must include both backend and frontend development. While sophisticated UI/UX design is not required, functionality will be prioritized in evaluations. The goal is to demonstrate learned Laravel concepts in a practical way, regardless of visual polish.
